    <h1>Romeo and Juliet</h1>
    <h2>ACT 1</h2>
    <h2>PROLOGUE</h2>
    <h4>
        <p>Two household,both alike in dignity,</p>
        <p>In fair Verona,where we lay our scene,</p>
        <p>From forth thefatal loins of these to foes</p>
        <p>A pair of star-cross'd lover's take their life;</p>
        <p>Whose misadventured piteous overthrows</p>
        <p>Do with their death bury their death-mark'd love,</p>
        <p>And the continuance of their parents' rage,</p>
        <p>Which, but their children's end, nought could remove,</p>
        <p>Is now the two hours' traffic of our stage;</p>
        <p>The which if you with patient ears attend,</p>
        <p>What here shall miss, our toil shall strive to mend.</p>
